	- Import the topography data
	- Import the geology image
	- Create a legend for the geology image
	- Create a magnetic survey with the following parameters:
		- Height above topography = 50 m
		- Easting origin = 556,440 m
		- Northing origin = 7,133,000 m
		- Bearing = 0 degrees
		- Number of lines = 11
		- Line length = 2000 m
		- Line spacing = 150 m
		- Data spacing = 50 m
	- Set the field parameters for the newly created magnetic survey:
		- Inclination = 83.3 degrees
		- Declination = 19.5 degrees
		- Field strength = 59,850 nT
