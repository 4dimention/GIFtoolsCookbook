"A to Z" demo
======================

This demo was created for the Fall 2017 consortium meeting. It is called "A to Z" because it shows how to start from a simple geology image all the way to an inversion, with **everything being done in GIFtools**.

This demo shows how to import a few basic files, design a survey, create a mesh, make a physical property model, forward model data, use that data and invert it.

While the demo is simple, it opens up a whole range of possibilities to **test hypotheses**, **explore the model space**, and **quantify the inversion quality**. See the :ref:`discussion questions <discuss>` to get started.

.. _discuss:

- Discussion questions
	- Survey and model
		- Does the survey need to be adjusted to better image the anomalous response?
		- Are we using the right geophysical method to detect the desired target?
		- ...
	- Forward model
		- Is the anomalous response large enough compared to expected noise and instrument sensitivity?
		- How does the data change if the model has greater or less physical property contrast?
		- How deep can the deposit be before we cannot detect it anymore?
		- ...
	- Inversion
		- Does the recovered model match expectations?
		- What can be done to improve the recovered model?
		- What happens when we start to use non-default parameters?
		- What happens when the uncertainties are increased or decreased?
		- Can we include reference models? Impose bounds? Include cell and face weighting?
		- What other information do we have to constrain the inversion?
