Activities for learning
=======================

These activities include files and parameters necessary to complete a certain task within GIFtools. They utilize some of the key capabilities within GIFtools and if you can do these, you're pretty much a GIFtools expert!

    Create an octree mesh <exercise1>
    Forward model a survey <exercise2>
    Invert for a model <exercise3>
    Create a model <exercise4>
    A-to-Z demo <atozdemo>

**All activities are focused on a single exploration area**: the Tli Kwi Cho (TKC) kimberlite complex. Synthetic models were used in conjunction with the real survey locations and/or parameters to create a suite of problems and examples to use when demoing GIFtools and for creating documentation.

`UBC-GIF <https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/>`_ has worked extensively on the TKC area. For background about the deposits, the geophysical surveys, and the outcome (including a combined petrophysical model), see the `Case History on EM Geosci <https://em.geosci.xyz/content/case_histories/do27do18tkc/index.html>`_.

**Each of these activities are a bit open-ended**. This is purposely intended. If we give step-by-step instructions, it can be too easy. That being said, **step-by-step instructions are available within this cookbook**.
