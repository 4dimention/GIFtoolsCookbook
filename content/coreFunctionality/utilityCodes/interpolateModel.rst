Interpolate a 3D model to another 3D mesh
=========================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``interpolate_model`` can be done by creating an *interplate_model* item. This item will interact with the utility program to interpolate a model with a 3D mesh (*not* ocTree) to another 3D mesh. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Interpolate models** |rarr| **Mesh3D to mesh3D**
