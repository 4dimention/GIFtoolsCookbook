Invert 2D DC and IP Data
========================

In this recipe, we step through inverting data, starting from a data file, a 3D mesh, and a topography file. At the bottom of this page, you will find the :ref:`files used in this recipe as well as the complete project and output files <invExample>`. This recipe uses a magnetic data file and a 3D mesh but the steps are nearly identical for each data and mesh type in GIFtools.

This recipe requires the following steps:

#. :ref:`Import a data file, a mesh, and a topography file <invStep1>`
#. :ref:`Create an inversion item in GIFtools <invStep2>`
#. :ref:`Edit the options <invStep3>`
#. :ref:`Write the files <invStep4>`
#. :ref:`Run the inversion <invStep5>`
#. :ref:`Import the recovered models and predicted data <invStep6>`
#. :ref:`View the convergence curve, misfit maps, and more <invStep7>`
