.. _objectFunctionalityActiveGeoModel:

Create Constant Geological Model
--------------------------------

This feature allows the user to create a geology model where all active cells (below topography) and inactive cells (air cells) can be assigned constant physical property values. Once created, the user is responsible for setting the physical property values for the active and inactive cells; see :ref:`geology models <objectFunctionalityGeoModel>`. This functionality is accessed through:
