Delete data outside of mesh
===========================

This function allows the user to remove data outside of a 3D mesh region that is of interest. With any method that deletes data locations, a *new* data object will be created after mesh-based removal. There are two options to choose: (1) removal outside the horizontal extent of the mesh or (2) removal outside the entire extent of the mesh. To perform either of these two tasks, click on the data object and then use the following menu (number coorresponds from above):

#. **Data manipulation** |rarr| **Remove data** |rarr| **Outside mesh lateral extent** or

#. **Data manipulation** |rarr| **Remove data** |rarr| **Outside of an entire mesh**
