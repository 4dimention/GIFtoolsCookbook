Write inversion files to directory
==================================

Prior to running the inversion, the user must write the appropriate inversion files to the working directory. For inversion that require sensitivity calculations (magnetics, gravity, gravity gradiometry, IP, etc), see below. To write all files, regardless, click on the inversion item, select the menu showing its class (e.g., ``E3Dinversion``):

**[Inversion class]** |rarr| **Write all**

Write inversion files with a sensitivity prerequisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For those inversions that require sensitivity matrices (and weighting), using the **Write** **All inversion files** will work. If the user is managing the file and only wants to write the specifics, the inversion executable files will be under the **Write** menu:
