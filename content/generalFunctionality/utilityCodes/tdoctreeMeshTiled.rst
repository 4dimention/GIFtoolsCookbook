Create an ocTree mesh for TEM data (tiled)
==========================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_octree_mesh_td_main_parallel`` can be done by creating a *TDtiledmeshcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from a TEM data item for the inversion program ``TDoctreeinv_GN``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **TD (tiled)**
