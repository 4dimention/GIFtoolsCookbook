Create an ocTree mesh for TEM data
==================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_octree_1mesh_td`` can be done by creating a *TD1meshcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from a TEM data item for the inversion program ``TDoctree_1mesh``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **TD (1 mesh)**
