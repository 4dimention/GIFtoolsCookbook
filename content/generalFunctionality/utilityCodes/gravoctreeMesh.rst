Create an ocTree mesh for gravity
=================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_octree_mesh_mag`` can be done by creating an *GRAVcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from a gravity data item for the inversion program ``octgravde``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **Gravity (PDE)**
