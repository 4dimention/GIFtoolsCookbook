Interpolate a 3D model to an octree mesh
========================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``3DModel2Octree`` can be done by creating an *mesh3DtoOctreeModel* item. This item will interact with the utility program to interpolate a model with a 3D mesh to an octree mesh. The utility gives the option to use the input octree mesh or generate a new refined octree mesh.

To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Interpolate models** |rarr| **Mesh3D to octree**
