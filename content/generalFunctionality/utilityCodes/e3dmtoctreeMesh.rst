Create an ocTree mesh for MT and ZTEM data
==========================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``MTcreate_octree_mesh_e3d`` can be done by creating an *MTcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from an NSEM data item for the inversion program ``ED3MT``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **E3DMT (and ZTEM)**
