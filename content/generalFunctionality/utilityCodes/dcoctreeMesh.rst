Create an ocTree mesh for DC data
=================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_octree_mesh`` can be done by creating a *DCIPcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from an DC or IP data item for the inversion program ``DCoctree`` and ``IPoctree``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **DC (and IP)**
