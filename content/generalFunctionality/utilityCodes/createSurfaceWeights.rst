Create surface weights for an octree mesh
=========================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_weight_file`` can be done by creating an *createSurfaceWeight* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an octree surface weighting file. The input file specifies the number of surface layers and the weight assigned to each surface. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Octree utilities** |rarr| **Create surface weights**
