Create a simple ground or airborne survey
=========================================

To create a simple ground or airborne survey for potential field data, use the menu structure below:

**Create** |rarr| **Survey** |rarr| **Simple surface/airborne survey**

The following dialog will pop up:

The dialog requires the following parameters to be input by the user. The figure at the bottom also shows what the parameters indicate.

- **Survey type**: Select the desired survey type from the drop-down menu. The options include total-field magnetics, magnetic amplitude, gravity, gravity gradiometry, gravity gradiometry (VK1), and gravity gradiometry (FALCON).

- **Topography**: Use either a constant topography value or a TOPOdata object by selecting the desired radio button. For a value, provide the value in the text box. For a TOPOdata object, use the drop-down menu to select available objects from the project or use the browse button to import a topography file.

- **Height above topography**: The value to drape the receivers at. If a constant topography value was given, then the receivers will all be at a constant height above that value. If a TOPOdata object was selected, the receivers will be draped at the height given above the topography. To place the receivers at a constant height even if there is topography, select "Value" and enter 0. Then simply give the desired elevation for the receivers in the box for height above topography.

- **Easting origin**: The easting coordinate for the southernmost point on the westernmost line. Note that this may not be the southernmost point OR the westernmost point, depending on the bearing chosen.

- **Northing origin**: The northing coordinate for the southernmost point on the westernmost line. Note that this may not be the southernmost point OR the westernmost point, depending on the bearing chosen.

- **Bearing**: The bearing of the survey lines, using a compass (i.e., north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, etc).

- **Line length**: The length of the survey lines.

- **Number of survey lines**: The total number of survey lines.

- **Data spacing**: The distance between receivers along a survey line.

- **Line spacing**: The distance between individual survey lines.

Click OK to create the new data item. It will have the easting, northing, and elevation columns set in the I/O headers.

Below, we have filled in the dialog to create a magnetic survey.

Once we click OK, we'll see the MAGdata item in the GIFtools project tree as "NewSurvey (MAGdata)". The survey can be viewed using VTK. The diagram below also explains what most parameters mean.
