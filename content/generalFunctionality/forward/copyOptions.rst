Copy a forward model item
=========================

Once the forward model has ran and the results loaded, GIFtools does not allow the straight copying of the forward model item (it has been "archived" and becomes a folder). It does, however, allow you to copy the options that were chosen for the forward modelling to a new one. Click on the forward model item, select the menu showing its class (e.g., ``MAGforward`` or ``GRAVforward``):

**[Forward class]** |rarr| **Copy options**
