Create a model
==============

In this activity, you are given a mesh, a topography file, and a geologic image (with world file). There is also a file that explains the units shown in the geologic map and expected physical property values. The goal is to create a physical property model (GIFmodel) using modelBuilder in GIFtools.

- **Task: create a survey**
        - `Download the activity <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sdevries/ActivitiesForLearning/Exercise4.zip>`__
- **Discussion questions**
    - With one physical property model, can you create a second using the same geologic model?
    - Can you view the model?
    - Can you create an isosurface?
- **Take it a bit further**
    - Given a different mesh, can you interpolate the model you created onto a new mesh?
    - Can you create face weights in modelBuilder based on the geologic map?
- **Helpful links**
