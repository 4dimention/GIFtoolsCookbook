Invert for a model
==================

In this activity, you are given a xyz file of gravity data over the TKC area, a mesh, and a topography file. The goal is to recover a density contrast model using the `GRAV3D <http://grav3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6.0/>`__ code.

- **Task: invert for a model**
        - `Download the activity <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sdevries/ActivitiesForLearning/Exercise3.zip>`__
- **Discussion questions**
	- What uncertainty did you assign to the data?
	- What does the convergence curve look like? The misfit map? The model?
	- What parameters did you use in the inversion?
- **Take it a bit further**
	- Can you edit the uncertainty from the misfit map?
	- Can you copy the inversion and use a different initial model?
