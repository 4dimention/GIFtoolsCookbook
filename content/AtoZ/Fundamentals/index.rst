    The Objective Function <ObjectiveFunction>
    The alphas parameters <Alphas>
    The weighting matrices <WeightingMatrix>
    Lp and Lq norms <Norms>
    The Trade-Off Parameter<Beta>
    Including the Reference Model in the Smoothness Term<MrefInSmooth>

This section was elaborated with the contribution of Marc Grujic from Rio Tinto.
