Here, we demonstrate the interpretation of FEM data through both independent
1D and laterally constrained 3D inversion approaches. Although full 3D FEM
inversion algorithms have been developed, they are significant time and
processing power to compute a final model. Meanwhile 1D and laterally
constrained 3D inversion approaches are computationally fast algorithms,
capable of recovering information about 3D conductivity and susceptibility
structures. The tutorial for the EM1DFM code is split into three parts:
