Laterally Constrained 3D Inversion
==================================

Here, frequency-domain data are inverted using the laterally constrained 3D
inversion approach. Just like in the previous exercise, every 1D model is
associated with a distinct sounding location (see `EM1DFM package overview
<http://em1dfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/overview.html>`__). However
lateral constraints are added such that the set of recovered 1D models are
smooth horizontally and can ultimately be constrained and interpreted in 3D.
The laterally constrained 3D inversion algorithm is a computationally fast way
to invert FEM data while taking into account both vertical and horizontal
variability of the Earth. The final model recovered by this algorithm is fully
3-dimensional.

    Recovered 1D models with topography and lateral constraints

The lateral constraints strategy comes with many advantages:

    - Neighboring 1D conductivity models are more consistent
    - Conductivity structures are interpolated in 3D, possibly highlighting trends in the model and easing the interpretation.
    - Possible to employ a :math:`\beta`-cooling strategy similar to the 3D inversion code.

The use of a global measure of data fit allows us to assess the convergence of
the algorithm through the usual :ref:`convergence curve<convergence_curve>` window.

    Convergence curves


Ideally we would like to test the hypothesis of a conductive overburden in 3D, as well as to impose bounds on the conductivity values.
which we covered in the :ref:`next section<AtoZem1dfm_lateral>`.

.. _AtoZem1dfm_lateral_constr:

Geological Constraints: Hypothesis Testing
------------------------------------------

It is well known that at TKC, there is a till overburden covering a portion of the survey area.
As a final example we will impose 3D geological constraints on the laterally constrained 1D inversions.
The geological constraints assume we have some a-priori information about the distribution and thickness of the overlying till.
To apply geological constraints, we first need to create the reference conductivity model from a surface:

Creating a Reference Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, we use surface topography and a surface object to define the upper and lower surfaces of the till layer, respectively.
We then assign reasonable physical property values for the till and background.
To accomplish this task, we use the model builder module.

    - :ref:`Import the surface<importSurface>` file provided (TillLayer.topo)
    - Select one of the 3D mesh objects created from a previous inversion and :ref:`create active model from topography<createActiveCellsModel>`. Use *from tops of cells*.
    - Select the active cells model and :ref:`create a model builder module<createModelBuilder>`
    - From ModelBuilder -> Create Model
        - Using surface
            - Populate values
                - Assign :math:`10^{-4}` S\\m
    - Change model values for the basement
        - Model->Edit
            - Replace value
                - Old value: 0
                - New value: :math:`10^{-5}` S\\m

We can now use this physical property model to define surface weights in order
to encourage large gradients at the bottom of the till layer.

This final solution differs from the previous inversion such that:
    - A sharp gradient is preserved along the base of the till layer
    - The upper conductivities are more consistent :math:`\approx 10^4 \Omega \cdot m`
    - The top of the kimberlite pipes is at the right depth, and the compact shape of the pipes is better preserved
