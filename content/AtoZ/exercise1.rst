Create an octree mesh
=====================

In this activity, you are given a magnetic airborne survey location file and a topography file over the TKC area. There is also a file with the magnetic survey parameters (inclination, declination, field strength). The deposit is expected to extend about 400 m below the surface.

- **Task: create an octree mesh using GIFtools**
        - `Download the activity <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~sdevries/ActivitiesForLearning/Exercise1.zip>`__
- **Discussion questions**
        - What cell sizes are appropriate?
        - What do each of the different parameters mean in the create-mesh dialog?
        - What are each of the generated files?
- **Take it a bit further**
        - Now that you have a mesh, can you create a whole-spaced model?
        - Can you create an active cells model?
        - Can you view the mesh and overlay the survey locations on it?
