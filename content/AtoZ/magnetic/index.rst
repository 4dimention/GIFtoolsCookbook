Here, A to Z examples relevant to the processing and inversion of magnetic
data in the presence of remanence.  The effect of remanence has long been
recognized as an obstacle for the geological interpretation and modeling of
magnetic data. Remanence is known to be associated with saeveral types of
mineral deposits, such as Banded Iron Formation, volcanic massive sulphides
(VMS) and diamondiferous kimberlites. In a mining exploration context, having
the wrong assumption about the magnetization could result in false drilling
targets: costly both in time, resources and confidence in geophysical methods.
Hence the need for a robust processing that does not require knowledge about
the orientation of magnetization.  This tutorial will make use of three
inversion codes and their respective solutions:
