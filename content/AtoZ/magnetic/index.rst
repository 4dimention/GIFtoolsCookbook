   	Magnetic Susceptibility: Forward Modeling and Inversion <MagSusc>
   	Equivalent Source Processing with Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) Data <TMI_EQS>
   	Magnetic Vector Inversion (MVI) <MVI>

For each A to Z example, a brief overview of the tutorial is provided along with its relevance to practical problems.
